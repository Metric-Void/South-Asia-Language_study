====
Urdu is one of the 22 official languages in India, and the official national language of Pakistan. It is also a registered regional language of Nepal.

Script
------
Urdu is written in `Perso-Arabic`_ Script. More on that in the linked page.

Relation with Hindi
-------------------
Urdu is mutually intelligible with Standard Hindi, which means the speaker of either can easily understand another language. They're structurally the same language. Hindi is written in Devanagari script, while Urdu is written in Persian Alphabet.
Both Urdu and Hindi have a large number of Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian words. Hindi have more special words from Sanskrit, and Urdu have more special words from Persian.
The separation of this two languages are mostly religious and political reasons, after India and Pakistan separate from each other.

Urdu Literature
---------------
Urdu Literature started quite late, with the earliest found around 14th century, and flourishing around 16th century. However, no real prose literature developed before the 19th century. Urdu literatures lean heavily towards poetry and short stories. Long proses are restricted to an ancient form called Dastan, which dealt with magic and superficial events, and they're called Dastaangois.

Ghazal
~~~~~~
Ghazal is a type of poetry, which is well developed in Urdu. It have a fixed format:

- It consists of rhyming couplets, called *Sher* or *Bayt*.
- A Ghazal have at least 5 *sher*s. Most have 7 to 12 *sher*s. Almost all of them have less than 15 *sher*s.
- Couplets end with the same rhyming pattern and have the same meter.

The most strict form must follow five rules, listed below. The uniqueness of Ghazals come from *qaafiyaa*(rhyme) and *radif*(refrain).

- Matlaa: The first *sher*. Set the tone of the ghazal, and determine its rhyming and refrain pattern.
- Radif: Refrain. Both lines of the matlaa and the second lines of all *sher*s must end in the same rhyme.
- Qaafiyaa. Following the radif, words with the same end rhyme pattern.
- Maqtaa. Last couplet of the ghazal. The most personal part, reflects creativity.
- Beher. Each line of a ghazal must have the same metrical pattern (same number of words).
