Introduction
============
Project Goal
------------
South Asia is an area with a rich historical background. During its thousands of years of history, different cultures take root in this area and left their footprint here.  For example, there're 22 official languages listed in Indian Constitution alone. Citizens may only speak one or two of them, but all 22 have numerous speakers across the country, not to mention minor languages.

Different characteristics of languages encode different aspects of life. From the language, we can get a brief idea of their social life. The basis of every language is that they must satisfy the need of daily communication. If some concept is being frequently or widely used, then there must be a word for it. For example, there's a word in Brazillian Portuguese: "Cafune". It means, "caress the hair of the one you love", and Sanskrit have lots of words describing woman appearance.

Languages also play a role in social classification. In most languages, different people should speak differently. Take Japanese as an example, some sentence structures are oriented only for man or women. You also need to reform the verbs when you're talking to people older than you. These characteristics reflected strong attention on gender division and respect for seniority.

In this project, I will discover different languages in South Asia and their specialties. I will focus on when and where they were spoken, what language family they belong to, what's special about each language, and so on. For convenience, I will arrange these languages according to the areas they were being spoken in.

Project Scope
-------------
Since the number of languages in South Asia is vast, only those with a large number of speakers, or those with significant context will be discussed.
