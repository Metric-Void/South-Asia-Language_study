General Indo-European
---------------------
Indo-European is the language family with themost speakers. :cite:`Ethno` It is also the most popular language family in India, with 78.05% of its population speaking some kind of Indo-European language :cite:`Briticanna_Indo`, and 19.65% speaking Dravidian language.

The Indo-Aryan branch
---------------------
Indo-Aryan languages are mostly related to Iranian languages to the west, and are colelctively called *Indo-Iranian* family, a major branch of *Indo_European* Family. They have similar features to Greek, but are more likely to be common innovations, rather than preserved features from the Indo-European dispersal.

History
~~~~~~~
Indo-Aryan and Iranian speakers splitted no later than 2000 B.C. Rather than the geological distribution nowadays, it was a north/south division rather than a east/west one. The southern branch was Proto-Aryans, moving south via Central Asia, reaching south asia. They entered northwest India through Afghanistan and Bactria. The Bactria part is then occupied by Proto-Iranians.
