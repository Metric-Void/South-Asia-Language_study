From this piechart, we can see that India does not have a "central" language. Hindu have a dominance, but not by a large margain. That's also why Indian government documents have to be distributed in several languages, and we often see multilingual traffic signs. One language to notice is Sanskrit. Modern Sanskrit is almost a dead language :cite:`nelson17`. It is an old language that carried lots of great literature, but few people use it as the first language. Although Sanskrit have few speakers nowadays (so few that it is shown as 0.00% in the piechart), Hindu is actually a register of Sanskrit. Lots of its vocabulary came from Sanskrit.

Also from this chart, we can see that there's little difference between the ratio of languages used by men or women. Traditionally Sanskrit are only spoken by nobel men, and women must speak dialects no matter how prestigeos they're. But in the census data from 2011, the number of men Sanskrit speaker is 8,189, while women have 5,946 sanskrit speakers. Other languages show a similar indifference of speaker by gender. This is a demonstration of ongoing equivalence between men and women.
