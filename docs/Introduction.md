# Introduction
South Asia is an area with rich historical background. During its thousands of years of history, different cultures take root in this area and left their footprint here.  For example, there're 22 official languages listed in Indian Constitution alone. Citizens may only speak one or two of them, but all 22 have numerous speakers across the country, not to mention minor languages.

Different characteristics of languages encode different aspects of life. From the language, we can peek into their social life. The basis of every language is that they must satisfy the need of daily communication. If some concept is being frequently or widely used, then there must be a word for it. For example, there's a word in Brazillian Portugese: "Cafune". It means, "caress the hair of the one you love", and Sanskrit have lots of words describing woman appearance.

In this project, I will discover different languages in south asia and their speciaties. I will focus on when and where they were spoken, what language family they belong to, what's special about each language, and so on. For convenience, I will arrange these languages according to the areas they were being spoken in.
